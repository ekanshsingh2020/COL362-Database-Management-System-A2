The part before @ should match the student_id for example, ’YYYYABC123’, where the first four digits being entry year, the next three characters are department ID ( dept_id ), and the last three digits are sequence number (seq_number). The second half of the email (after the ’@’) should start with the department ID of the student (ABC in this case). This should match the department ID, i.e., the three characters in the student_id column of the student as well as the department ID in the dept_id column and end with ’.iitd.ac.in’.
