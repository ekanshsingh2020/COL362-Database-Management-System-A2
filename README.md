# Assignment 2 : Database Design for Course Administration
- The objective of this assignment was to design a database for course administration purpose
- The schema is provided in the assignment document attached
- Initial part of the assignment involved creating the database with the given datatypes and contraints
- We were then supposed to add check constraints on top of those as given in the assignment document
- Post this we were supposed to use views, functions, procedures and triggers to support all the advanced constraints so that we don't run into loops or lead into modifying the parts of database which we don't intend to
- The submission file is in the folder 2020EE10490 and individual parts are present in ipynb files, they might not be in sync but the final submission file is correct
- The Java test file used for evaluating your submissions uploaded here https://github.com/VNSAditya02/DBMS-A2
- To execute the test file, follow these instructions:
  - Begin by creating a database and importing the submitted SQL file into it
  - Once done, you can run the test file (after compilation), specifying the database name as a command-line argument
  - For compilation, there is a folder named 'cp' in the repository. You may use it (optional) to compile the Java file using the following command: javac -cp "cp/*"Â  test.java
  - Then you can execute the command java -cp "cp/*":. test dbname to run the test cases
  - Alternatively, you can install JUnit and compile the test file
  - Don't forget to change postgres username and password in Lines 14 and 29 of test.java
- Almost all the test cases passed for the provided code
